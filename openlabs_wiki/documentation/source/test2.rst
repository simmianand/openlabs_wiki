Includes Images in Wiki Content
-------------------------------
For having images on the wiki pages, the user can browse them from the given folder or upload them to the wiki pages.

We are including two html templates in this model named *media.html*, and
*result.html*.

**media.html** is used to upload the images from the system and **result.html** is used to show the images to the wiki pages.

User saves the images to a specific folder and image path is saved to the
database and user can view all the images which he has stored and can use
on muyltiple wiki pages if he has created them already.
